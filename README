What is libapril ?

Some time ago I attempted to create a linux distribution that would
be a modern day desktop operating system for "old" computers. This
means systems like my own - 256 MB SD RAM, 40 GB hard drive, 1.5 GHz
Pentium 4 ... basically computers that are created and supported
no more.

April was the name of such a project, and it wasn't really a general
purpose operating system. I personally use Fedora Core 4 as my
primary operating system, but when I just wanted to listen to some
music or watch videos or stuff, I wanted something that would start
up quickly and be really fast. Hence April. Network support was
being implemented too.

Another reason was to create an intelligent desktop. The system
had a registry, could restart components automatically and
configured itself to suit the host system at boot. 

It could boot on a system with 8 MB of RAM. Even DSL can't do that
( I've checked ).

Life happened, and the project is now shelved ( temporarily ).
I will go back to it in the future, but meanwhile, here is some code
that people might find a tad useful. It has something as simple as
april_message_box_info ( gchar * message ) to registry functions ( aka 
MS style ).

Enjoy !
